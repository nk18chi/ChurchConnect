Title: Welcoming International Church

We visited Tokyo Community Church for the first time last Sunday
and felt immediately welcomed. The worship was contemporary with
a live band, and the pastor's message was biblically solid and
easy to understand. They offer English and Japanese services, and
we attended the English service which had about 100 people. The
children's program was excellent - our kids loved it! After the
service, several people introduced themselves and invited us for
coffee. We'll definitely be back.

Helpful info: Parking is limited, but there's a coin parking
nearby. They also livestream services if you can't attend in person.
```
